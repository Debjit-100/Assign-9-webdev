In React, hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to write reusable logic that previously could only be done with class components and lifecycle methods.

Hooks are identified by the naming convention. The name of a hook always starts with the word "use". This convention is essential because it allows React to perform certain checks and ensure that hooks are used correctly.

There are several built-in hooks provided by React, such as:

useState: It allows you to add state to a functional component. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state.

useEffect: It allows you to perform side effects in your component, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or manipulating the DOM. It runs after every render of the component.

useContext: It allows you to access the value of a React context within a functional component.

useRef: It provides a way to store mutable values that persist across component renders.

useMemo: It allows you to memoize expensive calculations, so they are only recomputed when their dependencies change.

useCallback: It returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. It's useful when passing callbacks to child components to optimize performance.

These are just a few examples of the built-in hooks provided by React. Additionally, you can create your own custom hooks by combining these hooks or creating reusable logic specific to your application.

Remember that hooks can only be used in functional components, not in regular JavaScript functions or class components prior to React 16.8.
