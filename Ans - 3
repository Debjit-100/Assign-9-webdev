In React, there are several ways to pass data from one component to another component. Here are a few commonly used approaches:

Props: The most common method is to use props. Props allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component. The parent component can pass data as attributes to the child component, and the child component can access the data through its props.
Parent Component:


import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const data = 'Hello, Child Component!';
  
  return (
    <ChildComponent message={data} />
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
Child Component:


import React from 'react';

const ChildComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>{props.message}</div>
  );
}

export default ChildComponent;
Context: React context provides a way to share data across components without passing it through props at every level. You can create a context in a parent component and then consume that context in any child component that needs the data.
Parent Component:


import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

export const MyContext = createContext();

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState('Hello, Child Component!');
  
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={data}>
      <ChildComponent />
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
Child Component:


import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { MyContext } from './ParentComponent';

const ChildComponent = () => {
  const data = useContext(MyContext);
  
  return (
    <div>{data}</div>
  );
}

export default ChildComponent;
Redux: Redux is a state management library that allows you to store and access data globally. You can define a central store that holds your application's data, and any component can access and update that data through Redux actions and reducers.

Query Parameters/URL: If you want to pass data between components through the URL, you can use query parameters. Components can read the query parameters from the URL and extract the necessary data.

These are just a few approaches to pass data between components in React. The choice of method depends on the complexity of your application, the relationship between the components, and the scope of the data you want to pass.
